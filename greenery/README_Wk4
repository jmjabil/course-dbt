if your organization is using dbt, what are 1-2 things you might do differently / recommend to your organization based on learning from this course?
I have been doing some of this along the way...
I've added post-hooks to some of our models for ensuring Grants for the various roles are kept up-to-date. I am also adding Exposures and updating our dbt run jobs based on info learned in this course.


how would you go about setting up a production/scheduled dbt run of your project in an ideal state? 
We are already using dbt Cloud. 
I am updating our scheduled dbt runs to ensure we are re-seeding each time as well as tests, freshness checks, and generated docs.
