PART 1:
What is our overall conversion rate?
62.5 %

What is our conversion rate by product?

NOTE: conversion rate is defined as the # of unique sessions 
with a purchase event / total number of unique sessions. 
Conversion rate by product is defined as the # of unique sessions 
with a purchase event of that product / total number of unique sessions 
that viewed that product

PART 2:
Create a macro to simplify part of a model(s). 
Think about what would improve the usability or modularity of your code by applying a macro. 
Large case statements, or blocks of SQL that are often repeated make great candidates. 
Document the macro(s) using a .yml file in the macros directory.

Part 3:
Add a post hook to your project to apply grants to the role “reporting”. 
Create reporting role first by running CREATE ROLE reporting in your database instance.

After you create the role you still need to grant it usage access 
on your schema dbt_<firstname>_<lastinitial> 
(what you set in your profiles.yml in week 1) 
which can be done using an on-run-end hook

You can use the grant macro example from this week and make any necessary changes for postgres syntax

PART 4:  After learning about dbt packages, we want to try one out and apply some macros or tests.
Install a package (i.e. dbt-utils, dbt-expectations) and apply one or more of the macros to your project

PART 5: After improving our project with all the things that we have learned about dbt, we want to show off our work!
Show (using dbt docs and the model DAGs) how you have simplified or improved a DAG using macros and/or dbt packages.
